# auth-service-with-jwt


The jwt-authentication-project is a secure system that improves how users log in and sign up by using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This project offers a strong and effective solution for keeping user authentication secure through the use of JWT. We've built this system with a focus on making it simple and secure, ensuring users have a smooth experience while also keeping their sensitive information safe.

**JWT Integration:** We use JSON Web Tokens to make user authentication secure and efficient.  

This project is continually evolving, and I welcome contributions and feedback from the developer community.
